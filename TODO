cpanspec
 * Make an option to spit out the cpanspec deps?
 * Could probably replace the processed and rpm provides stuff by creating a binary repo inside the docker container and using it.
 * Review messages for a verbosity level.
 * Verify version checks are correct and used in all the required places
 * Verify library handling. e.g. Devel::CheckLib etc
 * Use caching for yum & dnf
 * Some things are still yum only and need dnf added
 * Try and consolidate yum/dnf commands
 * Review use of qx, it doesn't catch failures
 * List build order, including deps that can be built in parallel.
 * Review FIXME's
 * Accept an srpm as input

eh????

cs-docker
 * catch <CTRL>-C and use "docker stop ..."
  * http://www.weave.works/my-container-wont-stop-on-ctrl-c-and-other-minor-tragedies/
 * Make sure any deps built in the Dokerfile get put in the right place
 * replace --file and --module with ARGV parsing so order can be maintained when file and module are mixed
 * Handle --verbose as cpanspec does

dist-import
 * This is a script that checks what changes needs to be made in koji/brew (branching, dist creation, etc)
 * include it?
 * make --import take a list of srpms instead of one srpm
