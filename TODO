Planned features (as of 2011-09-01):

Try to get cpan_home from CPAN::MyConfig or CPAN::Config instead of
  hard-coding $pkgdetails.

Add an option to honor %_sourcedir and such.

Handle Devel::CheckLib
	e.g. Math-Prime-Util-GMP uses gmp so Requiesgmp and BuildRequiresgmp-devel.

Some moduels aren't getting their test deps pulled in properly.
 Path::Abstract
  Test::Warn
  Test::Exception
  Test::Differences
  MooseX::Method
   Test::Moose

Add option to use local spec file
  for use when having to add patches or massage spec file

Need to generate a full list for dep build order, including those that can be built at the same time

cs-docker
  * Allow support for supplying multiple modules to cs-docker
  * Make sure when cpanspec gets multiple packages on the cli it always build them in the order supplied
  * catch <CTRL>-C
  * might need to clean out work_dir to avoid artifacts polluting output

dist-import
  * include ??
  * make --import take a list of srpms
