Planned features (as of 2011-09-01):

Try to get cpan_home from CPAN::MyConfig or CPAN::Config instead of
  hard-coding $pkgdetails.

Add an option to honor %_sourcedir and such.

Handle Devel::CheckLib
	e.g. Math-Prime-Util-GMP uses gmp so Requies gmp and BuildRequires gmp-devel.

Some moduels aren't getting their test deps pulled in properly.
 Path::Abstract
  Test::Warn
  Test::Exception
  Test::Differences
  MooseX::Method
   Test::Moose

Add option to use local spec file
  for use when having to add patches or massage spec file

Need to generate a full list for dep build order, including those that can be built at the same time

cpanspec
 *  make an option to spit out the cpanspec dependencies

cs-docker
 * catch <CTRL>-C
  * http://www.weave.works/my-container-wont-stop-on-ctrl-c-and-other-minor-tragedies/
 * Make sure any deps built in the Dokerfile get put in the right place
 * replace --file and --module with ARGV parsing so order can be maintained when file and module are mixed

dist-import
  * include ??
  * make --import take a list of srpms
