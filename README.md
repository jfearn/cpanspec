# cpanspec

This is my fork of cpanspec, it is focused on:

1. Making cpanspec work with my [mock](https://github.com/jfearn/mock) patch
1. Allowing overriding core perl modules by installing in site instead of vendor

Upstream project is at [sourceforge](http://cpanspec.sourceforge.net/). More information is available on the [ Fedora Project Wiki](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Perl/cpanspec).
